# WavetableSynthesis

THE PROJECT

The main aim of this project is to create a synthesiser VST plugin using C++ and the JUCE framework. I have had some experience making VSTs before using IPLUG2, but these we much simpler. With this project I hope to have a polished end synth that is comparable to some free synths available, such as the MAudio plugins.
