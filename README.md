# WavetableSynthesis

The main aim of this project is to create a wavetable synthesiser VST plugin using C++ and the JUCE framework. I have had some experience making VSTs before using IPLUG2, but these were much simpler. With this project I hope to have a fully fledged synth that is comparable to some free synths available.

For more info on current status and details on each part of the synth, please see the wiki.
