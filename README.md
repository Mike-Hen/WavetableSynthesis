# WavetableSynthesis

THE PROJECT

The main aim of this project is to create a synthesiser VST plugin using C++ and the JUCE framework. I have had some experience making VSTs before using IPLUG2, but these we much simpler. With this project I hope to have a polished end synth that is comparable to some free synths available, such as the MAudio plugins.

FEATURES
In the current state I have developed some basic building blocks for the synthesiser. When these are more polished I will look to adding some more interesting elements.

 - Oscillators - there are currently 2 oscillators with adjustable waveshape and volume level
 - ADSR - ADSR is currently function, but clicks when a note is pressed or released
 - Distoriton - Distoriton is currently working fine, more options could be added
 - Filtering -
